# funtasy

Typescript implementation of Elm ADTs.

# Philosophy

Elm's deliberate lack of typeclasses made them come up with a more-user friendly API, that does not require teaching developers even more new jargon such as `chain`, `liftA2`, etc.

So lets do that, only for TypeScript.

And since we're already doing this, lets add [fantasy land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) support.

# Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install funtasy
```
